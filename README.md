** Project Overview
Data-driven analysis of 5,000 Indian road accidents using Python (EDA), R (hypothesis testing), and Tableau (dashboard). Identifies key risk factors like helmet use, weather, and alcohol involvement to improve road safety insights and policymaking.

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python*: Data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis
- **R Programming*: Hypothesis testing (T-Test, ANOVA, Chi-Square, etc.)
- **Tableau*: Interactive dashboard and data visualization

##  Key Insights
- **Helmet/Seatbelt usage** significantly reduces fatalities (p < 0.05)
- **Foggy & rainy weather** are high-risk conditions
- **Alcohol involvement** leads to more severe accidents
- **Two-wheelers** are most involved in accidents
- **15–24 age group** is most at risk

## *Source:** [Kaggle – Accident Prediction in India](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
**File:** `accident_prediction_india.csv`  
**Size:** 5,000 records  

**Key Columns:**  
-  **Helmet/Seatbelt Usage** → Whether safety gear was used (Yes/No)  
-  **Weather Condition** → Clear, Rainy, Foggy, etc.  
-  **Road Type** → Highway, City road, Rural road  
-  **Accident Severity** → Minor, Major, Fatal  
-  **Age Group** → 15–24, 25–40, 40+  
-  **Alcohol Involvement** → Yes/No  
-  **Vehicle Type** → Two-wheeler, Car, Truck, etc.  

##  Future Work
- Integrate real-time GPS accident data
- Apply ML models for severity prediction
- Build live accident hotspot maps
