**##  Project Overview
Data-driven analysis of 5,000 Indian road accidents using Python (EDA), R (hypothesis testing), and Tableau (dashboard). Identifies key risk factors like helmet use, weather, and alcohol involvement to improve road safety insights and policymaking.

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python*: Data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis
- **R Programming*: Hypothesis testing (T-Test, ANOVA, Chi-Square, etc.)
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard and data visualization

##  Key Insights
- ****Helmet/Seatbelt usage* significantly reduces fatalities (p < 0.05)
- **Foggy & rainy weather* are high-risk conditions
- **Alcohol involvement* leads to more severe accidents
- **Two-wheelers* are most involved in accidents
- **15â€“24 age group* is most at risk

##  Future Work
- Integrate real-time GPS accident data
- Apply ML models for severity prediction
- Build live accident hotspot maps
